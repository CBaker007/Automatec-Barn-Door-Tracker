Here are list of parts used to build the prototype.   Every part must meet certain specs and substitutes 
will work as long as they meet those specs.  Some parts are more specific (for example the microprocessor)
and while substitutes will work, you must verify every spec or possibly re-write/change the code and recompile
a new binary.
