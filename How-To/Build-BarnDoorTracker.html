<h1>Base Unit - Wood Parts</h1>
  <h2>Step 1 - Cut 1x6" Pieces</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut two pieces of the 1x6 boards to 12-3/4" (12.75" or 324mm) long. </li>
    <li>Mark one board "Top" and one "Bottom".</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Step 2 - Attach Hinge(s)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The parts list suggests two different options for the hinge; A single piano hinge or Two 2" (50 mm) long hinges.</li>
    <li>If you are using a single piano hinge, first cut it to be slightly narrower than the 1x6 board's width (5-1/4" or 133 mm).</li>
    <li>Measure the width of your hinge (not including the round, pivot part).</li>
    <li>Draw a line, that distance and parallel from the short edge, one on the left edge of the "Bottom" board and one on 
      the right edge of the "Top" board. This line helps keep the hinges parallel to the edge and keeps the boards aligned when closed.</li>
    <li>Using the lines, mount the hinge(s) so it is parallel to the edge, following the line.</li>
  </ol>
